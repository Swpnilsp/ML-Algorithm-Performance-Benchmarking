# ML-Algorithm-Performance-Benchmarking

Rpubs report- https://rpubs.com/swapnil_s_patil/binaryClassification

The purpose of this project is to benchmark top machine learning algorithms to solve a binary classification problem.
Following algorithms are benchmarked-
1. Logistic Regression
2. Least Absolute Shrinkage and selection (LASSO)
3. Classification Tree
4. RandomForest
5. Generalized Additive Model
6. Neural Nets
7. Linear discriminant analysis
8. Gradient Boosting Machine- GBM
9. eXtreme Gradient Boosting- XGBoost

The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was used to benchmark performance of each of the algorithms. The asymmetric cost function was used to decide optimum cutoff probability.
